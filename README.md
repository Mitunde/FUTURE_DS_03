## Introduction
This report presents a comprehensive analysis of student feedback collected via the Student Satisfaction Survey. The objective of this analysis is to evaluate the quality of the educational experience, identify key drivers of student satisfaction, and pinpoint specific areas for institutional improvement.
The dataset includes ratings on a 1–5 scale, where 1 = Very Dissatisfied and 5 = Very Satisfied.
After data cleaning and visualization, the analysis revealed trends that highlight both strong performance areas and opportunities for improvement.

## Tools Used
- Microsoft Excel → Data cleaning and preparation
- Python (Pandas, Matplotlib, Seaborn) → Data analysis and visualization
- Power BI / Excel Charts → Dashboard creation for better insight presentation

##  Insights 
- Average satisfaction rating: 4.0 out of 5 → indicates overall positive student experience
- Highest-rated aspects:
Teacher’s communication ability → Average: 5.0
Teacher’s preparation for class → Average: 5.0
- Lowest-rated aspects:
Syllabus coverage → Average: 3.0
Teaching approach → Average: 3.0
- 80% of responses were within the 4–5 range, showing strong satisfaction but still room for improvement in course structure and teaching consistency.

## Stakeholder Questions Answered
Analyze Ratings (1–5 Scale) to Find Patterns of Satisfaction
- Ratings skew heavily toward 4 and 5, showing strong satisfaction.
- Ratings of 3 occurred primarily in questions about syllabus coverage and teaching methods, highlighting improvement areas.
- Consistent 5-star ratings in communication and preparation reflect strong engagement and teaching clarity.

  ##  Explain Other Trends and Insights
- The B.VOC Food Technology course displayed uniform satisfaction patterns, showing consistent teaching quality.
- Evaluation fairness received 4–5 ratings, reflecting student trust in grading.
- Positive correlation between teaching approach and communication skill ratings shows that interactive teaching improves student satisfaction.

## Recommendations 
- Enhance Course Coverage – Ensure all syllabus content is covered before assessments.
- Adopt Interactive Teaching – Use discussions, case studies, and practical sessions for deeper learning.
- Regular Feedback Loops – Conduct mid-semester surveys to track and address issues early.
- Improve Evaluation Transparency – Share grading rubrics and feedback clearly with students.
- Encourage Instructor Development – Organize training on student engagement and digital teaching tools.

## Conclusion
The Student Satisfaction Survey reveals an overall positive sentiment, driven by strong ratings in Teacher Communication and Preparation. However, the analysis identifies ICT Tool Usage and Student Mentoring as critical areas needing attention, rather than syllabus coverage. By pivoting toward interactive, digital-first learning and establishing structured feedback loops, the institution can bridge these gaps to enhance both student satisfaction and academic outcomes.
